This problem is called **\"Variance error\"**\n\n**\"K-fold Cross validation\"** technique provides a smart move to avoid this problem. It split the training data into k equaled groups & perform the prediction process on 1 group, the other groups are used for training the model. The whole process will be repeatedly carried out for each group & averaging the accuracy of them all to get the final result ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import KFold #for K-fold cross validation\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score #score evaluation\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict #prediction","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.104524Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.104877Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.109012Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.104845Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.108184Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Cross validate models with K-fold cross validation\nKfold = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=SEED)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.110138Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.110455Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.121581Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.110428Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.120612Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ML_algos = {\n    'KNN' : neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(),\n    'SVC' : svm.SVC(probability=True, random_state=SEED),\n    'GaussianNB' : naive_bayes.GaussianNB(),\n    'DTree' : tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=SEED),\n    'RFor' : ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(random_state=SEED),\n    'LReg' : linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV(random_state=SEED),\n    'GrB' : ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=SEED),\n    'ExTree' : ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier(random_state=SEED)\n}\ncv_result = dict()\ncv_mean = dict()\ncv_std = dict()\n\n# Compute the cross validation result of each ML algorithm\nfor name, ML_algo in ML_algos.items():\n    cv_result[name] = cross_val_score(ML_algo, X_train, y=y_train, scoring='accuracy', cv=Kfold, n_jobs=3)\n    cv_mean[name] = cv_result[name].mean()\n    cv_std[name] = cv_result[name].std()\n    ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.123182Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.123477Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.096836Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T13:47:13.123448Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.095523Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ML_cv = pd.DataFrame({'cv_mean' : cv_mean, 'cv_std' : cv_std})\nML_cv","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.098442Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.099297Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.116875Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.099247Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.115737Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nax = sns.barplot(x=ML_cv['cv_mean'], y=ML_cv.index, orient='h')\nax.set_title('ML algorithms cross validation mean values', fontsize=15)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.118677Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.119495Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.380124Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.119448Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T13:47:20.37945Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a name='4.2'></a>\n## 4.2 Hyper parameters tuning\n- Each model architecture has their own set of parameters which is called \"Hyperparameters\".\n- \"Hyperparameters tuning\" is a process of constructing clear plan to search for the ideal model architectures by choosing the best options for the their set of parameters ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Cleaner & greater ways forhyperparameters\n# Hyperparameter Tune with GridSearchCV\nn_estimators = [10, 50, 100, 300]\n\ngrid_param = [\n    #
